# Combat Log Report - Player's Guide

## 🎮 For Players: What You Need to Know

### What is this mod?
This mod tracks when you disconnect during PvP combat and reports it to all players on the server. It doesn't punish you, but everyone will know if you combat logged.

### When am I "in combat"?
You're in combat when:
- ⚔️ You hit another player, OR
- 🛡️ Another player hits you

Both you and your opponent will be tagged in combat **for 15 seconds**.

### What happens when I enter combat?

```
You hit another player...
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  You are now in combat!                      │
│     Logging out will be reported for 15 seconds!│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How long does combat last?

**15 SECONDS** from the last hit.

- If you hit someone again, the timer resets to 15 seconds
- If someone hits you again, the timer resets to 15 seconds
- You must wait 15 full seconds with NO fighting to safely log out

### Combat Timer Countdown

As the timer winds down, you'll see warnings:

```
Combat ends in 5 seconds...
Combat ends in 4 seconds...
Combat ends in 3 seconds...
Combat ends in 2 seconds...
Combat ends in 1 seconds...
✅ You are no longer in combat!
```

## ⚠️ What Happens if I Log Out During Combat?

**A REPORT WILL BE BROADCAST!**

If you disconnect while in combat:
1. 📢 All players on the server are notified
2. 🕒 The message shows how much combat time was remaining
3. 👥 Your reputation may be affected
4. 💼 Your character logs out normally (no death, no item loss)

### Example of Combat Logging Report:

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I disconnect during combat?
A report message is broadcast to all players. You won't die or lose items, but everyone will know you combat logged.

### What if my game crashes during combat?
The mod can't tell the difference between a crash and intentionally disconnecting. A report will still be broadcast.

### What if someone keeps hitting me?
The timer resets every time either player attacks. You need 15 seconds of NO combat to be clear.

### Does this apply to PvE (fighting mobs)?
**No.** Only player vs player combat triggers the combat tag.

### What about accidental hits?
Any player damage counts. Even one accidental hit will tag both players for 15 seconds.

### Will I lose my items if I combat log?
**No.** This mod only reports the incident. You keep all your items and log out normally.

### Can server admins see the reports?
Yes, the reports are broadcast to all online players including admins.
