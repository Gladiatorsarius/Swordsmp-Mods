# Combat Log Report - Player's Guide

## 🎮 For Players: What You Need to Know

### What is this mod?
This mod prevents you from disconnecting during PvP combat. It's designed to keep fights fair by making sure players can't just log out when they're losing.

### When am I "in combat"?
You're in combat when:
- ⚔️ You hit another player, OR
- 🛡️ Another player hits you

Both you and your opponent will be tagged in combat **for 15 seconds**.

### What happens when I enter combat?

```
You hit another player...
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️  You are now in combat!                      │
│     Do not log out for 15 seconds!              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How long does combat last?

**15 SECONDS** from the last hit.

- If you hit someone again, the timer resets to 15 seconds
- If someone hits you again, the timer resets to 15 seconds
- You must wait 15 full seconds with NO fighting to safely log out

### Combat Timer Countdown

As the timer winds down, you'll see warnings:

```
Combat ends in 5 seconds...
Combat ends in 4 seconds...
Combat ends in 3 seconds...
Combat ends in 2 seconds...
Combat ends in 1 seconds...
✅ You are no longer in combat!
```

## ⚠️ WARNING: What Happens if I Log Out During Combat?

**YOU WILL DIE!**

If you disconnect while in combat:
1. 💀 Your character is killed
2. 🎒 ALL your items drop on the ground
3. 📢 Everyone on the server is notified
4. 👥 Your opponent can take all your stuff

### Example of Combat Logging Punishment:

```
You're losing a fight with Steve...
You panic and disconnect...

❌ PUNISHED!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Your character dies
All items dropped at your location
Server message: "YourName logged out during combat!"
Steve collects all your items
```

## ✅ How to Safely Log Out

### Option 1: Wait Out the Timer
```
1. Stop fighting
2. Run away if needed
3. Wait 15 seconds
4. When you see "You are no longer in combat!"
5. Now you can safely log out
```

### Option 2: Defeat Your Opponent
```
1. Win the fight
2. Wait 15 seconds after the last hit
3. Receive the "no longer in combat" message
4. Log out safely
```

### Option 3: Create Distance
```
1. Disengage from combat
2. Create distance between you and opponent
3. Wait for the 15 second timer
4. Log out when clear
```

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I disconnect if I'm about to die anyway?
**No.** You'll still be killed and drop your items. There's no benefit to combat logging.

### What if my game crashes during combat?
The mod can't tell the difference between a crash and intentionally disconnecting. You'll still be killed and drop items.

### What if someone keeps hitting me?
The timer resets every time either player attacks. You need 15 seconds of NO combat to be safe.

### Does this apply to PvE (fighting mobs)?
**No.** Only player vs player combat triggers the combat tag.

### What about accidental hits?
Any player damage counts. Even one accidental hit will tag both players for 15 seconds.

### Can I use /spawn or teleport commands?
That depends on your server's other plugins. This mod only affects logging out.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Check Your Status
Watch for the combat messages. If you see countdown warnings, you're still tagged.

### Tip 2: Plan Your Exits
If you need to log out, finish your fights first or avoid combat zones.

### Tip 3: Keep Valuables Safe
Don't carry items you can't afford to lose in PvP areas.

### Tip 4: Communicate
If you need to leave urgently, try to communicate with your opponent. Some players may let you go.

### Tip 5: Fight or Flight
When tagged in combat, decide quickly: fight to win or disengage and wait 15 seconds.
